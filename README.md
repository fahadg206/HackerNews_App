# HackerNews Application 

- A news app that will inform the user of the latest news all around the world. There is also a popular news section that displays all the trending news articles. 

## Project Goals

- This project allowed me to get more practice making GET requests from an API. 

## How the app works

- There is a search bar where the user can search for any article they would like. Every article has a image, title, and brief description. When a user clicks on an article, it will open up a new tab and direct them to the news outlet that published that article. 

## Technologies Used

- React, News API, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Axios

## Quick Start

1. Download zip file or clone the repository on your local machine, and open it up in your code editor.
2. Open terminal and run **npm start** on the root folder.
3. Search for any article you would like in the searchbar.
